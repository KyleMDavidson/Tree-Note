I think we're all a little fatigued by the linear access of notes in traditional note applications - say Apple Notes or Evernote - scrolling a column of values or a matrix of thumbnails.

This is a react native application to help us move beyond that. It's for people with huge brains. It's for people who distribute their Zettelkasten notes around their Mind Palace before they do their Pomodoros.

Essentially, you have a root note. Call it Root. You then may have, say, three children of the root - work, home, and band. Recurse from there.

So you have structured notes, great. Now, the hard part - it's annoying to scroll a long list. It can also be annoying to make 5 decisions you view as one decision -
say, a route. The route you walk to work. Is that 100 decisions? or is it one subconsciously learned pattern you can always generate?

So we make our structured notes easy to access, and not just generate. You press your finger down on the root note, which displays it's children. Then you drag your finger
over the children. You recursively do this until you reach your target note. When you take your finger off the tree layout, you are navigated into the note you've chosen with the path you pressed.
